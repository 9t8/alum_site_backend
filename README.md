## useful extensions
* [thunder client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) for testing the api (todo postman?)
* [sqlite3 editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yy0931.vscode-sqlite3-editor) for viewing and manipulating the db (you will need python)
